This identifier represents a scanned request for a [DocumentReference](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference.html) that you will typically find on appointments where a scanned request file has been uploaded.

It's an unusual identifier used to point to an endpoint on Clic Sant√©'s API where the scanned request (pdf) is retrievable.  
After receiving a [DocumentReference](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference.html) with this identifier, you can call the endpoint contained in the system field to get the file and it's content.
